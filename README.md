[ ] Unsolved problems:
- not very responsive, my form submit button isn't linked to local storage or database. So any input from users is not stored.
- I couldn't install the motions NPM to add animations to my page. This created a fatal error with my terminal and forced me to create a whole new repository
- not enough design aspect/animation
- very basic CSS styling would like to use more complex methods.
